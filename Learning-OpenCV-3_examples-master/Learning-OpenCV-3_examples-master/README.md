# Learning OpenCV 3


This is the example code that accompanies Learning OpenCV 3 by Adrian Kaehler and Gary Bradski (9781491937990). 
  
**In progress May 24, 2017**

This code is in progress, currently at Chapter 15, bear with us, the code is coming, both Authors are busy, as always, building startups. If you want to help, request to join the project. Keep pull requests to one function at a time. It doesn't have to be just examples from the book, it can be other code snippets from the book, exercises, new functionality or even a "how to use" opencv_contrib functions.

Note, for your interest, included here is a _Docker_ file that
* Loads Ubuntu 16.04 
* Loads all dependencies for OpenCV 3.2 and opencv_contrib
* Loads and builds OpenCV 3.2 and opencv_contrib into a build directory 
  * executable files end up in opencv-3.2.0/build/bin
* Git clones the code (and Docker file) for Learning OpenCV 3 and builds it
  * executable files end up in Learning_OpenCV-3_examples/build
* To get to the top level directory, just type: `cd`
* If you just want to do this "by hand" in your home, replace the "RUN"s below with "sudo"


New code is added regularly. We apologize that all of the code from the
book is not up yet, but it will be uploaded as soon as possible. Please
bear with us, the authors and the staff are very busy people and we are
doing our best.
